          into Xero, not the accounting date.\r\nThe ‘as at’ date can not be overridden
          by the user.  This can be used to estimate a ‘historical frequency of reconciliation’.\r\n\r\nThe
          ‘as at’ date will affect the current statement in the response, as any candidate
          statements created after this date will be filtered out.  Thus the current
          statement returned will be the most recent statement prior to the specified
          ‘as at’ date.  Be aware that neither the begin date, nor the balance date,
          will affect the current statement.\r\n\r\nNote;  information is only presented
          when system architecture allows, meaning historical cash validation information
          will be an estimate. In addition, delete events are not aware of the ‘as
          at’ functionality in this endpoint, meaning that transactions deleted at
          the time the API is accessed will be considered to always have been deleted."
